* What kinds of stacks does PostScript manage and what are their roles?

  - Operand stack: Used for all computation. Holds operands and results of
    operators.
  - Dictionary stack: Holds key-value dictionaries
  - Execution stack: Holds executable objects, e.g. procedures in various stages
    of execution.
  - Graphics state stack: Keeps track of graphical state, e.g. current
    coordinates. Makes it easier to work with different coordinate systems.


* What is the way of defining a procedure in the PostScript program?

  You define procedures by binding names to a literal or executable object. The
  syntax has to following scheme:

      <key> <value> def

  The following definition binds a procedure object to the name "average":

      /average { add 2 div } def


* What are the roles of a dictionary and the dictionary stack in the PostScript
  program execution?

  Dictionaries are key-value storages that allocate space for local variables.
  It's also a scoping mechanism: by defining a dictionary and pushing it to the
  dictionary stack, we make sure that the names do not clash with names in
  other procedures' dictionaries.

  The dictionary stack keeps track of the dictonaries and plays a similar role
  as the runtime stack in most programming languages.
